		<p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial,
			so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

		<ul>
			<li>My name is {identity.firstName}</li>
			<li>I live in {identity.country} and I am trying to work as a {identity.occupation}</li>
			{
				identity.interests.length >= 2 &&
				<li>Two of my hobbies are {identity.interests[0]} and {identity.interests[1]}</li>
			}
		</ul>

		<p>My skills are:</p>
		<ul>
			{skills.map(skill => (
				<li class="skill">{skill}</li>
			))}
		</ul>
